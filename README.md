# Universal-Knowledge-Database
UKDB (Universal Knowledge Database) is an open, AI-agnostic format and toolchain for packaging knowledge. It turns folders of documents, notes, and files into a structured, portable knowledge pack with explicit sources, claims, and metadata, designed to be shared across conversations, tools, and AI systems without vendor lock-in.
